/**
 * A variable can be considered as container or storage box, where you can save date to be used later on in your program.
 * When you create a variable you, telling a computer to reserve a specific amount of memory.
 * once a variable is created, you can assign a value to it, and later you can retrieve/change its value.
 * this happens throughout the lifespan of your program.
 * variables have names and should be descriptive enough to give an idea of the data it holds.
 *
 *
 * The difference between val and var, is that we use val constant variables(immutable reference), and var can be changed
